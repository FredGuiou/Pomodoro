# Getting Started with Pomodoro App in React

This project is a try test on react after the first part of Udemy learning React.

The idea is to create a timer and save the time in a table.

When you click start the timer beggin, when you click stop it save the time spent in a table.

This challenge is great to practice states changes and using props to.

Have a good day ! ⏲️
